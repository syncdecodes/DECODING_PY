# DECODING_PY 🐍 

Welcome! This repository contains all the Python code I've written while learning the language.
It includes exercises, small projects, experiments, and notes gathered along my Python journey.

## 📚 About This Repo

This repository serves as:

- A personal learning archive

- A place to track my progress

- A reference for revisiting concepts later

- A public portfolio of my foundational Python work

Expect to find code related to:

- Basics of Python (variables, loops, functions, etc.)

- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)

- Object-oriented programming

- File handling

- Error handling

- Modules and packages

- Algorithms & problem-solving

- Mini-projects and practice exercises

🤝 Contributions

This is a personal learning repository, so contributions aren’t expected —
but suggestions, tips, or learning resources are always welcome!
